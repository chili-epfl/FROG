Still, I think the affordances of social media channels, though commercial and far from perfect, have changed civic the landscape of political activism. Gladwell's famous critique of Twitter and its overhyped role in social movements is a great example of how the role of social media in activism is still important to discuss.[ In an article for the New Yorker, he writes:](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2010/10/04/small-change-malcolm-gladwell)\n\n *‚ÄúSocial networks are particularly effective at increasing motivation,‚Äù Aaker and Smith write. But that‚Äôs not true. Social networks are effective at increasing participation‚Äîby lessening the level of motivation that participation requires. *\n\nI think his argument ignores the way social media might cast a broader net than traditional communication tools and it also might show would-be activists what the first steps of participation look like.

As you may know, we've organized most of this year's syllabus around the theme [Writing Our Civic Futures](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OPjztRuEGA3pI2v3mhAOB9_Q9OyDs4CJtwetzVkyXaI/edit?usp=sharing). If you, colleagues, or others in your network are interested in joining these future conversations, we can help with planning, onboarding, etc. It's great to see you here in the margins!",

I\'m also reminded of [this blog post](http://jeremydean.org/blog/uncategorized/dont-press-that-button-on-technological-critiquism/) by Jeremy about what he terms "technological critiquism." In his post he suggests that critique of various edtech efforts, or teaching practices, or whatever happens to be in (educational) vogue (and perhaps for quite problematic reasons) can "become enamored and blinded by their own brand. Such criticism basically reads like the same dystopian science fiction novel written over and over again: what seemed like a good idea at the time is now destroying us; the robots have risen up."\n\nPart of what I think you\'re suggesting (???) is that we recognize our own complicity in particular problems, and that we might be more honest in sharing our struggles with uncritical evangelism.

                      "I've been thinking of parallels to this kind of uncritical evangelism. It seems (given my own US political context right now) especially crucial to build a liberatory movement that is self-critical about its own problems and limits. It seems part of the point of movements to empower student voices or democratize web spaces to complicate our understanding of power dynamics and interrogate the ways that our own platforms (for example) subvert our intentions. I think our work will be stronger, not weaker, if we aggressively and generously show the ways that we fail, reinscribe problems, or struggle within broken parameters. I've always loved and admired and valued that kind of honesty in colleagues who work on these ideas.",
