 - **Stage 1**: Students (individually or in random groups) are presented with a writing prompt, and can use a rich-text editor to write their contribution
 - **Stage 2**: In the next stage, they receive one or several of the contributions from their peers (individuals or groups), and are asked to comment based on a review prompt.
 - **Stage 3**: Students then receive the feedback from other students, and can continue to work on their contributions, taking into account the feedback from the other students
 - **Stage 4**: Finally, all contributions are sent to the projector for the teacher to discuss and debrief.
