h2. learning:
    * [@corneli2012detecting]:
      * learning model 
        * A naıve idea: model learning as vocabulary acquisition
        * More complete: model learning as a change in patterns of behavior
        * Sophisticated: model learning in terms of the use of new heuristic strategies
    * [@corneli2011aparagogy]:
      * importance of the learning environment, containing learner, setting or space, where learner acts, using tools and devices, collecting and interpreting info, interacting with others.  -environment
        * environment should not be taken for given but co-constructed with peers
    * [@corneli2011paragogy]:
      * addresses challenge of peer-producing a useful and supportive context for self-directed learning -environment
    * [@corneli2011personalised]:

    * [@weller2011pedagogy]:
      * Wesch (2008) - affordances of physical learning environment (acquire, obey etc) -environment
    * [@kop2008connectivism]:
      * Learning 
        * learning happens when learner connects to and feeds information into learning community
        * learning community is a node, always part of larger network
        * nodes varying size and strength (concentration of info and number of people)
        * learning transpires through use of cognitive and affective domains
        * learning process is cyclical
        * peripheries of knowledge fields porous, learners may traverse networks through multiple knowledge domains
        * act of recognizing patterns shaped by complex networks
          * internal, as neural networks
          * external, as networks in which we adapt to the world around us (Siemens 2006b)
    * [@mcauley2010mooc]:
      * content, teaching can be duplicated, but learning happens in the individual, does not scale - needs support
    * [@kop2010networked]:

        * User-Identified high points (bookmarked threads and articles?)
        * Processing level (eg browsing vs attempting to solve problems?)
        * Quality of self-explanation (knowing how activities relate to goals?)
        * Exploration (trying different resources)
    * [@corneli2012paragogy]:
      * how can we detect "learning"? If we could see those microscopic events, could we engineer a system to make them come up more frequently?
h2. distrib_why:
    * [@corneli2010crowdsourcing]:

    * [@corneli2011paragogy]:
      * learner profiles for goal-setting and self-monitoring
    * [@corneli2011paragogy]:

    * [@corneli2011personalised]:
      * learners work through tasks together, or with a degree of peer support - benefit from access to sophisticated, personalised, socially-aware task tracking system   
        * closely integrated or Web as platform
        * learners will make use of wide range of tools anyway (Willson et al 2008) 
        * selecting objectives from large list of objectives, tools from list of tools, peers from list of peers etc - each choice implicit judgment about quality
        * we don't know if someone is moving from activity because finally satisfied, or because hopelessly frustrated
        * explicit evaluation/reflection phase (Fruhmann 2010), self-regulated learning (Zimmerman 1989)

Most of life spent on the low plain, doing informal learning, huge climb if you want to get something formalized. This topology might even out, many more small peaks - opportunities to formalize something. Gather evidence of learning on daily basis. Actually more similar to an academic's life
